It's informative to learn how much electricity these devices use, and find ways to optimize the usage. Plus, I love real-time graphs of data. Whee!\" 1. Energy monitoring af multiple appliances is important (explicit). 2. Data driven graphics for easy to understand visuals (latent). 3. Energy consumption education is a helpful skill (latent). \"I love my emporia meter and circuit monitoring system and this lets me have even finer detail. I plugged fridges into them so i can see how much they use in a day. NOTE: you cant use for devices that use 1200+ watts for more than an hour a day, otherwise its safety feature will shut it off. Emporia, please make a heavy duty one. I'd love to be able to plug in my Midea 12k BTU U-shape window AC, but it shuts down if it needs to cool a lot and run its compressor at 100% 1.

Outlet is desired for high amp applications such as running an AC unit (explicit). \"They say the \"outlets\" only use one receptacle, that is because the outlets are made to install one per 2 receptacle. This way it will not cover up more than one spot. However, if you install one in a 4 receptacle spot you will lose two spots, not a biggie. I installed the App and the electrical panel (called the Emporia Vue) unit first and then wanted to look at usage on a finer level so I installed some individual monitors. They were very easy to install (just plug them in) and attaching them to the app was easy. It did take a little time for the outlet to update the software but that is pretty common (several minutes). The bar chart is showing the outlet monitoring my surveillance system, which is 24/7. You can see that it is costing me about .42 cents in March so far to run the system. The next picture from the app shows I have 5 plugs installed so far. I am happy with them although I would like to see some improvements in the app to customize it for my specific needs[...].\" 1.

They began dropping the 'line' randomly, meaning, the relay inside would switch from on to off then on in about a half second. While I have these generally on non-critical devices, I also monitored two Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS), and that little blip on/off/on would cause the UPS to go from A/C to battery backup to A/C in the same time - just not good for them, or for me hearing them alarm because of it. And for other devices, even non-critical, having the power interrupt in a split second just adds wear and tear.  I contacted support, the first time it happened they sent me a replacement, which then did the same thing. It may be a wifi issue, but even a wifi issue shouldn't cause the device to interrupt power - it should simply retry connecting to the wifi in the same state it's been in. 1.
