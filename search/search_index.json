I really like the idea of a smart outlet, especially one which has 4 USB ports, which is critical in the smart phone era. The outlet itself works well - it was easy to set up the smart connectivity (through the app, which is also designed well), and the features through the app are easy to use (turn off certain outlets, timing, etc.). It also syncs with Echo, though it doesn't always work great tbh (the fault is actually on Echo's side to be honest, as the software is not always smart to differentiate between the outlet and other smart devices in the same room). The 3 star review is for the design of the traditional outlets - they are spaced too close to each other! Too many devices today require some kind of a bulky adaptor (including the aforementioned Echos), and unfortunately, once you plug one of those in, you basically have only one space left for anything else. So if you're going to use it close to your bed or a working desk, you should be ok.

I renamed the outlets and can now turn the lamp on just by asking Alexa to do it. I can also turn off the whole power strip the same way. The Feit app is also easy to set up and use so I had everything up and running in just minutes. The blue LEDs show me which outlet is on at a glance, so there's no guessing when using Alexa.

We will also obtain IPX4 sweat-resistant rating equal to Bose, House of Marley, and Amazon Echo earbuds, and aim to extend our range of colors, as seen in Urbanista and Jabra\u2019s lifestyle products.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#stakeholders","title":"Stakeholders","text":"<ul> <li>Target group Upper middle class people of 18 years and above.

The installation was straightfoward, the rugged stick pushed firmily into the ground,and the weather resistant spring covers gave him confidence that the outlets would stay safe from the rain and dust. with Wifi connectivity, Peter quickly programmed schedules from his phone so the lights automatically turned on at dusk.</p> <p>Over time, Peter noticed how well the product matched his expectations. The heavy six-foot cord allowed him to reach power comfortably, and the photocell sensor made sure his Christmas lights stayed on after dusk without extra effort. He even enjoyed the small touch of the included remote, which let him control the outlets when his phone wasn\u2019t nearby.</p> <p>User Story #2: Ayush Ayush is a 21 year old student, he recently upgraded his home office setup with the Kasa Smart Plug Power Strip KP303. He works remotely and wanted something easy to manage multiple devices without clutter. The simple app setup impressed him, it connected quickly to his Alexa, and within minutes, he could control his desk lamp, monitor and coffee machine with his voice. He found the interface intuitive and reliable, matching what others had said in their reviews. For Ayush, not having to juggle multiple individual plugs was a relief,  one strip that could handle all his essentials felt both practical and cost-effective.</p> <p>On weekends, Ayush enjoys experimenting with tech projects, so the extra flexibility came in handy. Inspired by a review, he used the power strip in his Halloween setup, running lights and sound effects triggered from his PC with a simple script. The surge protection gave him peace of mind while powering multiple gadgets, and the individual control over outlets meant he could turn off just the devices he didn\u2019t need.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#aspects","title":"Aspects","text":"<p>Our product design will be based on current market offerings for smart surge protectors, with improvements that adhere to the following requirements.
