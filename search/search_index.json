I really like the idea of a smart outlet, especially one which has 4 USB ports, which is critical in the smart phone era. The outlet itself works well - it was easy to set up the smart connectivity (through the app, which is also designed well), and the features through the app are easy to use (turn off certain outlets, timing, etc.). It also syncs with Echo, though it doesn't always work great tbh (the fault is actually on Echo's side to be honest, as the software is not always smart to differentiate between the outlet and other smart devices in the same room). The 3 star review is for the design of the traditional outlets - they are spaced too close to each other! Too many devices today require some kind of a bulky adaptor (including the aforementioned Echos), and unfortunately, once you plug one of those in, you basically have only one space left for anything else. So if you're going to use it close to your bed or a working desk, you should be ok.

I renamed the outlets and can now turn the lamp on just by asking Alexa to do it. I can also turn off the whole power strip the same way. The Feit app is also easy to set up and use so I had everything up and running in just minutes. The blue LEDs show me which outlet is on at a glance, so there's no guessing when using Alexa.

All team members participated in these sessions, and ideas were documented to ensure a shared record of contributions.</p> <p>To collect ideas, we used Lucid\u2019s brainstorming diagram tool, which allowed us to visually map, expand, and organize potential features. We drew heavily from the \u201cProduct Requirements\u201d team assignment, where we had compiled requirements based on customer feedback and reviews of comparable products. These reviews provided an important external perspective on user needs and common challenges, which we combined with our team\u2019s own requirements list and insights from brainstorming. Together, these sources gave us a pool of more than 100 possible features.  Once we had compiled the initial list, we grouped features into categories to clarify their purpose and relationships. The groups included Control &amp; Monitoring, Hardware Features, Power &amp; Performance, Connectivity &amp; Compatibility, User Interface &amp; Experience, Reliability &amp; Safety, Affordability &amp; Sustainability, and Advanced Features. These categories reflected different dimensions of the product\u2019s functionality, usability, and market positioning. For example, Control &amp; Monitoring encompassed how users interact with the device and observe its status, while Hardware Features captured the physical and electrical build of the product. Similarly, categories like Reliability &amp; Safety emphasized protections and standards, and Affordability &amp; Sustainability reflected both cost and environmental considerations.</p> <p>After grouping, we applied a ranking process to evaluate which ideas were most essential to the core goals of the project. By ordering features from most to least critical, we identified a set of \u201cCore Features\u201d that would form the foundation of the base product model. Additional features were then layered on to define more advanced product variations. This ranking exercise allowed us to balance innovation and user comfort with practical considerations such as feasibility and cost. The structured approach ensured that our design process emphasized both creativity and pragmatism, while giving us flexibility to differentiate across product tiers.</p> <p>Through this process of meeting, documenting, grouping, and ranking, we transformed an unstructured list of ideas into an organized and prioritized set of features. The outcome provided a clear roadmap for our design iterations and ensured that our product concepts remained aligned with both user needs and project goals. Ultimately, the brainstorming sessions gave us a strong foundation for moving forward into prototyping and refinement.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"05-design-ideation/#brainstorming-participants-tools-used-resources-grouping-ranking","title":"Brainstorming Participants, Tools Used, Resources, Grouping, &amp; Ranking","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"05-design-ideation/#our-brainstorming-ideas-grouped-into-categories-that-we-created-in-order-to-place-similar-or-related-features-in-buckets-to-keep-them-organized-below-is-a-chart-which-is-where-our-brainstorming-began-to-shape-our-features-into-organized-containers","title":"Our brainstorming ideas grouped into categories that we created in order to place similar or related features in buckets to keep them organized.

And, since we are developing a real product it will benefit entrepreneurs or engineering firms looking to actually sell a product like the one we design.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/04-Product-Requirements_AB/#aspects","title":"Aspects","text":"<ol> <li>Customization</li> <li>4.1 The product shall allow the user to use multiple control methods and be able to program the device by editing the code we develop to run customized routines.</li> <li>4.2 The product shall allow the user to customize power output from each plug and USB port.</li> <li> <p>4.3 The design is to be modular with the user customizing the location and type of each port.</p> </li> <li> <p>Manufacturing</p> </li> <li>5.1 The product shall be easy to manufacture.</li> <li>5.2 The product exterior should be manufactured with materials resistant to elements and use weather resistant mechanical components such as switches and plug covers.</li> <li>5.3 Plastic exterior should be biodegradable and/or recyclable.</li> <li> <p>5.4 The PIC Curiosity Nano microcontrollers used in the design shall be easily removable from the device for use in other projects.</p> </li> <li> <p>Safety</p> </li> <li>6.1 Product shall protect against overcurrent.</li> <li>6.2 Product shall protect against short circuits.</li> <li>6.3 Product shall filter the current to prevent spikes that may damage electrical components.</li> <li>6.4 Product automatically limits current to what each port can deliver. </li> <li>6.5 Product dissipates heat so it does not become a fire hazard with high current usage.</li> </ol>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/04-Product-Requirements_AB/#requirement-criteria-specifications","title":"Requirement Criteria Specifications","text":"<ul> <li>4.1.1 Device supports three control interfaces: physical buttons with a screen to display information, mobile app, and web interface.</li> <li>4.1.2 Device has a port for reprogramming.</li> <li>4.1.3 Source code is accessible for reprogramming.</li> <li>4.2.1 Power settings for each plug and USB-port can be specified with the control interface.</li> <li>4.2.2 Device provides real time feedback for desired output and delivers within +-5% of what was specified.</li> <li>4.3.1 Ports are mounted on interchangable modules with standardized connectors.</li> <li> <p>4.3.2 User can rearrange or swap out port types to design their own array of power sources.</p> </li> <li> <p>5.1.1 Material besides internal PCB and Curiosity Nano controllers is sourced from at least two different materials in case of unavailability.</p> </li> <li>5.1.2 There are at least two ways to manufacture the outer shell of the assembly, e.g. 3D printing or injection molding.</li> <li>5.1.3 Assembly time is under 30 minutes using basic hand tools.</li> <li>5.2.1 Enclosure meets IP65 rating for dust and water resistance while components are plugged in.</li> <li>5.2.2 Enclosure must pass 10 simulated outdoor durability tests, including being sprayed with water, shaken around in a container of dust, and a drop from shoulder height while components are plugged in (specific moisture level and particulate level to pass TBD). </li> <li>5.3.1 Outer shell assembly is made from biodegradable or recyclable plastic.</li> <li> <p>5.4 PIC Curiosity Nanos are mounted on headers allowing removal/replacement in under 2 minutes without soldering.</p> </li> <li> <p>6.1.1 Device includes automatic shutoff when current exceeds rated current(TBD); recovery requires manual reset.</p> </li> <li>6.2.1 IEC 62368-1 compliant.</li> <li>6.3.1 Includes EMI filters and transient voltage suppressors that reduce spikes to below 5% of rated current (TBD), verified via oscilloscope.</li> <li>6.5.1 Product operates between 32 - 122 degrees F</li> <li>6.5.2 Product does not exceed 122 degrees F during intended use.</li> <li>6.5.3 On board temperature sensor automatically shuts off device if temperature exceeds 122 F.</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/04-Product-Requirements_AB/#open-questions","title":"Open Questions","text":"<ul> <li>Can we manufacture this product for under $100?</li> <li>Can we find a safe way to merge high amperage needs with low?</li> <li>What type of interface would be the most marketable based on the requirement of reliable connectivity as well as convenience?: a remote, smartphone app, connected touch screen, etc.</li> <li>How do we achieve full dust and water protection when elements are plugged in, thus exposing some amount of the plug or USB port?</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/","title":"Appendix: Team Organization","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#team-goals","title":"Team Goals","text":"<p>List at least five shared goals that reflect a successful product with regard to EGR3X4.
