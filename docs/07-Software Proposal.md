title: Software Proposal
---

## Introduction
The intention of this section is to provide you with an overview of what our subsystem logic looks like overall, and how each individual PCB interacts and communicate with one another. Below are some questions we asked ourselves as we reseached our solutions and the sofware logic diagram that we produced.

## Research Question

* Bullet Point 1
* Bullet Point 2
* Bullet Point 3
