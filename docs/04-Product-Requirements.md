## Project Objective

This project aims to investigate and develop smart adaptive technologies, an improved user experience, better fit, improved product design, and product customization options for the next-generation AirPods. The target is to maintain global dominance in the wireless earphone market, drive up AirPod sales to 100 million+ units sold with a 60% global market share in 2021 and expand the user base more towards the luxury, professional, and fitness segments. We believe that adding smart interactions and adaptive audio filters alone will already expand our user base by 15%. With the new generation AirPods we aim to match at least the sound quality of our main competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, and include Active Noise Canceling that is also featured in Mifo, House of Marley, Bose, and Amazon Echo products. We will also obtain IPX4 sweat-resistant rating equal to Bose, House of Marley, and Amazon Echo earbuds, and aim to extend our range of colors, as seen in Urbanista and Jabra’s lifestyle products.

## Use Cases

**User Story #1: peter**
Peter is a 42 -year-old homeowner who enjoys seetting up his backyard for family gatherings and seasonal decorations.He recently purchased the HBN Outdoor smart plug to manage his string lights and small fountain. The installation was straightfoward, the rugged stick pushed firmily into the ground,and the weather resistant spring covers gave him confidence that the outlets would stay safe from the rain and dust. with Wifi connectivity, Peter quickly programmed schedules from his phone so the lights automatically turned on at dusk.

Over time, Peter noticed how well the product matched his expectations. The heavy six-foot cord allowed him to reach power comfortably, and the photocell sensor made sure his Christmas lights stayed on after dusk without extra effort. He even enjoyed the small touch of the included remote, which let him control the outlets when his phone wasn’t nearby.

**User Story #2: Ayush**
Ayush is a 21 years old student and he recently upgraded his home office setup with the Kasa Smart Plug Power Strip KP303. He works remotely and wanted something easy to manage multiple devices without clutter. The simple app setup impressed him, it connected quickly to his Alexa, and within minutes, he could control his desk lamp, monitor and coffee machine with his voice. He found the interface intuitive and reliable, matching what others had said in their reviews. For Ayush, not having to juggle multiple individual plugs was a relief,  one strip that could handle all his essentials felt both practical and cost-effective.

On weekends, Ayush enjoys experimenting with tech projects, so the extra flexibility came in handy. Inspired by a review, he used the power strip in his Halloween setup, running lights and sound effects triggered from his PC with a simple script. The surge protection gave him peace of mind while powering multiple gadgets, and the individual control over outlets meant he could turn off just the devices he didn’t need.
