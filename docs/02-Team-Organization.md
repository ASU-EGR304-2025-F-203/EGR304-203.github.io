## Team Charter

From the ... which can be reviewed in ["Appendix: Team Organization"](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/Appendix/App-Team-Org/), the team's charter formed to be:

> "Our team will design, prototype, and demonstrate an innovative home solution that leverages sensor-based technology to improve everyday household tasks. Each member will contribute a unique subsystem, implemented on a dedicated PCB, which will be integrated into the final system. The project will emphasize sensor amplification, filtering, and digitization to create a reliable and efficient design that saves resources, eliminates manual steps, and enhances convenience in the home environment."

## Product Mission Statement

Describe the distilled purpose, function, or reason for your product to exist. From this form a team mission statement. Google's mission statement is:

 > "Our mission is to create a practical, sensor-driven smart appliance system that simplifies daily living, conserves resources, and demonstrates the power of collaborative engineering through modular PCB-based design."
