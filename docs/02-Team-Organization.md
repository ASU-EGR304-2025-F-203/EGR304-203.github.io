## Team Charter
> "Our team will design, prototype, and demonstrate an innovative home solution that leverages sensor-based technology to improve everyday household tasks. Each member will contribute a unique subsystem, implemented on a dedicated PCB, which will be integrated into the final system. The project will emphasize sensor amplification, filtering, and digitization to create a reliable and efficient design that saves resources, eliminates manual steps, and enhances convenience in the home environment."

## Product Mission Statement
 > "Our mission is to create a practical, sensor-driven smart appliance system that simplifies daily living, conserves resources, and demonstrates the power of collaborative engineering through modular PCB-based design."
