|"I got this because the app is user friendly, easy to set up & it was easy to connect to my Alexa and works well [...] but still wish it was cheaper I wish the cord was longer though and it was a flat head plug"| App should be user friendly, affordable, and have a convenient plug shape (latent). |

|"I now own eight of these. I'm monitoring my PC, the sum of the PC and cable modem and wireless router and etc., a Raspberry Pi that does some neat things, a home air filter, the furnace (10 watts 24 hours a day, whether heating or not crazy!), the clothes washer, the refrigerator, and an audio power amp used only when watching movies. It's informative to learn how much electricity these devices use, and find ways to optimize the usage. Plus, I love real-time graphs of data. Whee!"  | 1. Energy monitoring af multiple appliances is important (explicit).<br><br> 2. Data driven graphics for easy to understand visuals (latent).<br><br> 3. Energy consumption education is a helpful skill (latent).
|"I love my emporia meter and circuit monitoring system and this lets me have even finer detail. I plugged fridges into them so i can see how much they use in a day. NOTE: you cant use for devices that use 1200+ watts for more than an hour a day, otherwise its safety feature will shut it off. Emporia, please make a heavy duty one. I'd love to be able to plug in my Midea 12k BTU U-shape window AC, but it shuts down if it needs to cool a lot and run its compressor at 100% | 1. The outlet provides detailed energy monitoring (explicit).<br><br> 2. Outlet needs a higher amperage rating of 15 amps or more (latent).<br><br> 3. Outlet is desired for high amp applications such as running an AC unit (explicit).
|"They say the "outlets" only use one receptacle, that is because the outlets are made to install one per 2 receptacle. This way it will not cover up more than one spot. However, if you install one in a 4 receptacle spot you will lose two spots, not a biggie. I installed the App and the electrical panel (called the Emporia Vue) unit first and then wanted to look at usage on a finer level so I installed some individual monitors. They were very easy to install (just plug them in) and attaching them to the app was easy. It did take a little time for the outlet to update the software but that is pretty common (several minutes). The bar chart is showing the outlet monitoring my surveillance system, which is 24/7. You can see that it is costing me about .42 cents in March so far to run the system. The next picture from the app shows I have 5 plugs installed so far. I am happy with them although I would like to see some improvements in the app to customize it for my specific needs[...]."|1. Large outlet format impedes adyacent outlets (latent).<br><br> 2. App is user friendly (explicit).<br><br> 3. Data should be visually represented and easy to read (latent).

|"Bought a set of 2 and could only get one to connect. Extremely hard to make initial connectivity with the plug. Could only connect to 2.4 ghz and had to shut down the 5 ghz signal just to connect. Very limited on amperage levels with guide saying no more than 10. Found them to be too impractical and returned them."| 1. Difficult connectivity setup (explcit).<br><br> 2. Compatibility with home networks (latent).<br><br> 3. Low amperage rating (explicit).
|"I'm no longer using most of these plugs any more. They began dropping the 'line' randomly, meaning, the relay inside would switch from on to off then on in about a half second. While I have these generally on non-critical devices, I also monitored two Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS), and that little blip on/off/on would cause the UPS to go from A/C to battery backup to A/C in the same time - just not good for them, or for me hearing them alarm because of it. And for other devices, even non-critical, having the power interrupt in a split second just adds wear and tear. <br> I contacted support, the first time it happened they sent me a replacement, which then did the same thing. It may be a wifi issue, but even a wifi issue shouldn't cause the device to interrupt power - it should simply retry connecting to the wifi in the same state it's been in. | 1. Device needs to be reliable (implicit).<br><br> 2. Redundancy when network is disabled(implicit). <br><br> 3. Device needs to support high amp appliances (explicit).
|"I have about a dozen of these installed at my house to either control or monitor electrical circuits. I have two big problems with these devices:

1. I had one fail shortly after install that was connected to a basement freezer. This device just failed, and the freezer did not have power for two days until I noticed it. Unfortunately, I had to throw away a few hundred dollars worth of food stored in that freezer.
2. They clearly state it now, but the didn't when I purchased these devices, but they are only 15 amps for 1 hour and then they shut down. I have an old house and have a few portable electric heaters plugged into these devices so I can turn on heat in the kitchen and bathroom on a schedule so it is warming up by the time I get out of bed. Unfortunately, these devices don't work well in that scenario, unless I want to switch all of the heaters to low power, which kinds of defeats the purpose of warming those spaces up quickly. They should stop the false advertising and just list these as 10 am devices. | 1. Notification to user is needed when power fails(implicit).<br><br> 2. Power management of multiple devices(explicit).<br><br> 3. Higher continuous draw support (explicit).
