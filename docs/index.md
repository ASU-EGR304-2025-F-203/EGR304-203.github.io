## Team Introduction

Our team got together with the simple goal of revitalizing the charging experience for everyone. Armando Botiller, Ayush Tathi, and Manuel Castro bring their expertise in Robotics Engineering together to innovate home solutions with sensor based technology and improve day to day life.

We are making a smart outlet that can monitor power indoor and outdoor that does away with the network connectivity and latency woes that plague current market offerings.

>Below are sections with links to our team member's individual datasheets for our subsystems. You will also find links that take you through our design journey in the below "Design Ideation" and "Team Block Diagram" sections<br>
