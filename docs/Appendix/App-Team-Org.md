## Team Goals

List at least five shared goals that reflect a successful product with regard to EGR3X4. Focus on team / product goals that are deeper than "getting an A".

**Engineer Useful Home Technology**

Design Home sensor-based tech which simplifies tasks, reduces manual work and provides convenience for our customers.  

**Develop and Integrate Subsystems**

Ensure each member delivers a functional subsystem on a dedicated PCB and works collaboratively to integrate all subsystems into a seamless, reliable final product.


**Advance Technical Expertise in Sensor Systems**

Apply principles of signal amplification, filtering, and digitization to achieve accurate, efficient, and resource-conscious sensor performance.

**Deliver a High-Quality Prototype**

Produce a well-documented, tested, and demonstrated system that reflects strong engineering practice, attention to detail, and professional standards.

**Foster Collaboration and Continuous Improvement**
Encourage knowledge-sharing, peer feedback, and iteration throughout the project to refine designs and maximize team effectiveness.

**Combine Team PCB's Into Working Prototype**

Integrate our team’s three PCB’s in a coherent and efficient fashion.

### Open Source Resources
The project documents will be open source and should be straightforward enough for external users to build their own version at home.
