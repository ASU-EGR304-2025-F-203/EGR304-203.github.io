|"...still wish it was cheaper I wish the cord was longer though and it was a flat head plug"                                                                                                                       | 1. Product should be affordable (explicit)<br>2. Plug shape should be convenient (explicit).                                |
|"First time using something "smart", decently easy to set up. Had to trouble shoot a few times but I got it. The only issue i have is the USB ports dont apply to the wifi controls of the power strip."           | 1. "Smart" shouldn't mean confusing (latent)<br> 2. User shouldn't run into a whole lot of troubleshooting (latent).<br>3. USB ports should be able to be individually controlled (explicit).
|"Product works great…. However. It is some what deceiving that this 3 outlet plug does NOT have the same features as the 5 outlet (HS300 plug). I need to have energy monitoring (wattage). The 3 outlet plug just tells you the ‘run time’ measured in hours which doesn’t really do anything. Otherwise, this smaller surge protector is seamless and works as advertised. I just need to return it and buy the more expensive one to meet my needs. I wish they were more clear with the product description."|Advertising should be clear (explicit). Should show power usage not just "run time"(explicit). A more expensive outlet shouldn't have to be bought to include these features (latent). A more compact outlet should include these features (latent).

One smart system should control as many plugs as possible (latent).                                                          |
|"I used it in an automated Halloween setup to control lighting of various scenes via a BAT script running on a PC via the Kasa Command Line interface..."|1. Product should allow manual control via a PC running a script and not rely on the smartphone app for automation (latent).                                                                                    |
