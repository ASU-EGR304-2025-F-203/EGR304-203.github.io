## Project Objective
>This project aims to investigate and develop a highly versatile smart power strip with an improved setup, more reliable interface, easy to program outlets and USB ports, for use in a wide range of electrical applications indoors as well as out. The outcome of this investigation and the prototype that will be created will benefit the industry as a whole, as we are posting all documentation, electrical schematics, code, and CAD files to our github page which is freely viewable and downloadable. We believe that by providing this research as a public resource it will benefit fellow ASU students taking EGR304 or similar embedded systems classes by providing an example of a project that can serve as inspiration. And, since we are developing a real product it will benefit entrepreneurs or engineering firms looking to actually sell a product like the one we design.

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** High-income upper-class professionals between the age of 20 and 45. Their personalities are determined and ambitious. The main benefits sought are recreation and self-expression.
- **Target purchaser** Target group profile with special attention to Full Nest I and Full Nest II mothers.
- **Customer service** Prefers easy-to-repair, recyclable product, and easy-to-fix complaints to fit with Apple’s intuitive user experience.
- **Marketing & Sales division** Looks for unique selling points around the Apple Aspirer-Explorer lifestyle and user experience.
- **Retailers** Prefer products that can withstand a wide range of storage conditions including variations in temperature, vibration, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and have a strong and compact, theft, and vandalism-proof packaging.


## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Jenna**
Jenna is a 33-year-old executive who regularly visits a bar for lunch to blow off some steam. The bar is often loud with people, but it is paramount that she can hold business conversations over the phone there. Then again, she does not want to miss out on the atmosphere and be able to hear the waiters as well. Her new Apple wireless earphones allow her to switch instantly between a mode where she can fully focus on the phone conversation and a mode where the phone call and environmental sound are seamlessly combined. They also allow her to rapidly adjust the volume on the earbuds themselves without having to take out her phone.

Jenna occasionally visits the bar in the evenings. She is a big fan of the L.A. Lakers, and whenever they play, she streams the live footage through her phone. Her new earbuds allow her to easily switch to hearing everything around her and streaming the match commentary without having to ever take the earbuds out.  She sometimes gets compliments on how stylish the earbuds look on her, and she wouldn’t want to miss out on hearing those either.

## Aspects

The new product design will be based on that of the AirPods with improvements based on the following requirements. The **P1 - P10** is the "code" to indicate the priority of the requirement, from low to high.

1. **Producr Design**
   * 1.1 The product shall be visually easy to distinguish from existing AirPods as well as main competitors Sony WF-1000XM3, Jabra Elite, Amazon Echo Buds, Samsung Galaxy Buds, and Bose SoundSport Free, and Urbanista Stockholm. (P10)
   * 1.1 The product shall be easy to recognize as an Apple product without needing a logo on its exterior. (P10)
   * 1.2. The product shall avoid styling elements from our Powerbeats over-ear wireless headphones since those address a different market segment. (P8)
  
1. **Functionality**
      * 2.1 The product shall incorporate one or more optical proximity sensors to detect the user wearing it. (P10)
      * 2.2 The product shall offer a dual microphone in each earbud. (P10)

## Requirement Criteria Specifications

* 1.1.1 - Regulate system power from 9 volts to 5 volts
* 1.1.2 - Provide over-amperage project to not exceed 1.5 amps.

## Open Questions

* Can we move towards a recyclable and repairable product, for example, with ZIF connectors and glue-free assembly?
* Can we improve on failing or self-igniting batteries?
