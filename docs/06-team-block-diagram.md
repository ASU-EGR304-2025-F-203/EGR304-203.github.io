## Introduction
This diagram demonstrates how each PIC Curiosity Nano micocontroller will take in analog signals, filter them, and process them through specific input pins, and which pins will output to analog devices or digital pins. Finally the diagram shows how we will communicate across microcontrollers using the 8 pin ribbon connectors.
