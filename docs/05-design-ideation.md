## Sparky Smart Power Solutions<br>
## Intro/overview<br>

The process of generating feature ideas from our requirements and customer feedback took two team meetings and inernal discussions with the team as we compiled lists, ranked the features, and ultimately sorted them to create three different product options. At the end our team came up with the following product offerings:

- **The Sparky Charging Hub:** a light duty charging sation with simple scheduling and timing options. Our low cost option.
- **The Pro Model:** an enhanced version of the sparky wiht a higher amperage raiting, user interactible screens and more safety features.
- **The Paragon Model:**  our fully equipped version that contains all of the features of the above offerings plus a battery backup system and more power outage protections.

Below is the process that we went through in order to come up with these features, we explain our reasoning as to why some were not included and our thought process when doing our revision changes from our first to second pass of our features.<br>


## Generating Ideas & Features<br>

Our brainstorming process took place over two videoconference meetings on Zoom, supplemented by several informal follow-up conversations. All team members participated in these sessions, and ideas were documented to ensure a shared record of contributions.

To collect ideas, we used Lucid’s brainstorming diagram tool, which allowed us to visually map, expand, and organize potential features. We drew heavily from the “Product Requirements” team assignment, where we had compiled requirements based on customer feedback and reviews of comparable products. These reviews provided an important external perspective on user needs and common challenges, which we combined with our team’s own requirements list and insights from brainstorming. Together, these sources gave us a pool of more than 100 possible features.<br><br>

Once we had compiled the initial list, we grouped features into categories to clarify their purpose and relationships. The groups included Control & Monitoring, Hardware Features, Power & Performance, Connectivity & Compatibility, User Interface & Experience, Reliability & Safety, Affordability & Sustainability, and Advanced Features. These categories reflected different dimensions of the product’s functionality, usability, and market positioning. For example, Control & Monitoring encompassed how users interact with the device and observe its status, while Hardware Features captured the physical and electrical build of the product. Similarly, categories like Reliability & Safety emphasized protections and standards, and Affordability & Sustainability reflected both cost and environmental considerations.<br>

After grouping, we applied a ranking process to evaluate which ideas were most essential to the core goals of the project. By ordering features from most to least critical, we identified a set of “Core Features” that would form the foundation of the base product model. Additional features were then layered on to define more advanced product variations. This ranking exercise allowed us to balance innovation and user comfort with practical considerations such as feasibility and cost. The structured approach ensured that our design process emphasized both creativity and pragmatism, while giving us flexibility to differentiate across product tiers.<br>

Through this process of meeting, documenting, grouping, and ranking, we transformed an unstructured list of ideas into an organized and prioritized set of features. The outcome provided a clear roadmap for our design iterations and ensured that our product concepts remained aligned with both user needs and project goals. Ultimately, the brainstorming sessions gave us a strong foundation for moving forward into prototyping and refinement.<br>


## Brainstorming Participants, Tools Used, Resources, Grouping, & Ranking<br>

- ### Our brainstorming ideas grouped into categories that we created in order to place similar or related features in buckets to keep them organized. Below is a chart which is where our brainstorming began to shape our features into organized containers<br>
![Brainstorming ideas and categories](Brainstorming1.jpeg)<br><br><br><br>

- ### The brainstorming ideas were then ranked first into four tiers, High Importance Features (High tier), Important Features (Mid tier), Low Importance Features (Low tier), and the very low tier. Here we focused on keeping the features that would impact the cutomer the most for performance, safety, and reliability, while also making sure we to not neglet the main complaints that were brought up when we investigated customer feedback.<br>

- ### You will also notice our team quickly realized that we could group all these important and not so important features toghether. This is where we did our first official pass of our feature list, and is where we evolved our tier ranking system into some thing more practical. In this pass, we moved all critical features into our "Core features" container, then the more useful, but not critical features were placed in the "Added Features" container, and lastly the features that did not fall into the first two containers were placed in the "Cosmetic.." container.<br>

- ### In our final pass the brainstorming ideas got re-ranked and with more stipulations such as feasability and budget contraints. Removed features are placed in the discarded features boxes.It is also important to note that the containers themselves were re-ordered to have the most important features on the left and least important features on the right.<br>

## Our 3 Concept Designs<br>

- ### The Sparky Charging Hub<br><br>
### Our base standard for greatness. A smart little charging hub that provides convenience and performance in a smaller package.<br>
