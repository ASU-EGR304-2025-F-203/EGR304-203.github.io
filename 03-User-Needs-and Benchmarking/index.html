|"Product works great…. However. It is some what deceiving that this 3 outlet plug does NOT have the same features as the 5 outlet (HS300 plug). I need to have energy monitoring (wattage). The 3 outlet plug just tells you the ‘run time’ measured in hours which doesn’t really do anything. Otherwise, this smaller surge protector is seamless and works as advertised. I just need to return it and buy the more expensive one to meet my needs. I wish they were more clear with the product description."|1. Advertising should be clear (explicit). <br> 2. Should show power usage not just "run time"(explicit). <br> 3. The device should be as feature rich as a more expensive or larger sized product (latent).</p>

However, if you install one in a 4 receptacle spot you will lose two spots, not a biggie. I installed the App and the electrical panel (called the Emporia Vue) unit first and then wanted to look at usage on a finer level so I installed some individual monitors. They were very easy to install (just plug them in) and attaching them to the app was easy. It did take a little time for the outlet to update the software but that is pretty common (several minutes). The bar chart is showing the outlet monitoring my surveillance system, which is 24/7. You can see that it is costing me about .42 cents in March so far to run the system. The next picture from the app shows I have 5 plugs installed so far. I am happy with them although I would like to see some improvements in the app to customize it for my specific needs[...]."</td>

<td>"This outlet has a lot of potential though the design is not the best. I really like the idea of a smart outlet, especially one which has 4 USB ports, which is critical in the smart phone era. The outlet itself works well - it was easy to set up the smart connectivity (through the app, which is also designed well), and the features through the app are easy to use (turn off certain outlets, timing, etc.). It also syncs with Echo, though it doesn't always work great tbh (the fault is actually on Echo's side to be honest, as the software is not always smart to differentiate between the outlet and other smart devices in the same room). The 3 star review is for the design of the traditional outlets - they are spaced too close to each other! Too many devices today require some kind of a bulky adaptor (including the aforementioned Echos), and unfortunately, once you plug one of those in, you basically have only one space left for anything else. So if you're going to use it close to your bed or a working desk, you should be ok. But it's certainly not optimal for a media unit (with routers, modems, TVs, etc. where a surge-protected power-strip might be a better choice)."</td>

<td>"This smart power strip turned out to be a great alternative to in-wall smart switches and smart plugs because it can control each of the 4 outlets plus the USB cluster individually, all in one unit. So I can plug in a lamp, a humidifier and anything else that can stay in the ON position and turn them on or off in the app. The cool part is that it functions the same way through the Feit Electric app as it does in the Alexa app once I linked them. I renamed the outlets and can now turn the lamp on just by asking Alexa to do it. I can also turn off the whole power strip the same way. The Feit app is also easy to set up and use so I had everything up and running in just minutes. The blue LEDs show me which outlet is on at a glance, so there's no guessing when using Alexa. The power strip isn't all that larger than a non-smart power strip either, so it's easy to tuck away."</td>

Once you have an item setup on the power strip you can control the on/off state and setup timers to turn the item off and on when needed. You can also setup Alexa or Google so that you can control the power strip items via voice command. I have yet to try it but you should be able to integrate this power strip with other smart home items such as turning the strip off when you leave home and on when you return."</td>

<td>"The smartplug works fine. The only features is wifi on/off and scheduled on/off (e.g. on at 6pm and off at 10pm). Unfortunately, the app does NOT have more advance features - e.g. If you turn a device on, you want it to automatically turn off in 10 mins. (e.g. you forget to turn off your light). Or to have it on "all the time" and to turn off for only 10 mins and automatically on after 10 mins - (e.g. Pumps in an Aquarium during feeding). Other smart plugs have such features. I just wished they incorporated these features. Maybe the company need to hire more creative app designers."</td>

<td>"I ordered three of these because I had (and still have) such great experiences with Feit's smart bulbs. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for their smart plugs. Two out of the three would not complete pairing or would pair then stop working if I tried to move them to a different outlet. While the pairing process is not difficult, per se, I experienced many, many failures in trying to pair all three of them...whether in Auto or AP mode. This past Sunday was the last straw. I tried for two hours to pair both of the two in different outlets and different rooms. They would <em>occasionally</em> pair, but then the WiFi radio would disconnect and stop working. Most of the time, they wouldn't even pair. <br> I'm giving this two stars because one of them (finally) did pair and so far has stayed paired. But I'm afraid to move it because I think it will crap out on me again. I ended up a buying a 4-pack of "another brand" at Lowes for $20, and they work <em>flawlessly</em> (so far). <br> I highly recommend their smart bulbs, but I would steer clear of these unless you want to roll the dice and take a chance and them not working..</td>

<td>"Pros: Purchased this because it shares the same Feit app as the several in-wall hard-wired dimmer switches I have in the house. Easy setup and convenient when it does work, even has a on/off switch for manual operation. <br> Cons: Not reliable, once every few weeks this device will go offline requiring unplugging and reconnecting to reboot. I have concerns about turning lighting or device on/off from overseas while on vacation. I'm sure there are more reliable brands out there, but again, I kept this just because I have other devices using the Feit app. <br>Overall: Good value if you don't mind the occasional offline and reset, even with the router 2 feet away.</td>

<td>"Excellent outdoor light sensor/timer! We've been using one for years, and finally got another to go along with it. The timing part is great, as its presets are pretty much exactly what we want: after it gets dark, how many hours to leave the power going. Of course, we use this for Christmas lights and, on occasion, some festive summer lights. Our original one has been through several years of Pacific NW weather - that is, rain, lots of drizzly rain. And that exposes the biggest downside to this - the cover over the top of the dial gets fogged up easily, so you can't see the insides very well. (It probably also interferes at least a little bit with the light sensing, but not enough for us to take notice.) All in all, this outdoor plus has served us well - so well, in fact, that we recently got another. The original still works great, but we wanted additional lights and available plugs. Highly recommended!"</td>

It's too bad they used inferior materials through out the construction of the unit, because I would use this all year round if it was built better. <strong>IF</strong> you use this <strong>ONLY</strong> for the Christmas season, one of these will last you about 5 years or so. I have owned mine for 3 years, and it's still working as advertised, but I have mine fastened to a Wreath (Large wreath for the front door) powering the lights on just that ornament. That way, when it's time to put it up, no fuss, just hang it, and plug it in. MUCH easier than trying to "re-dress" the lights every year. When Christmas is over with, it all goes back in the wreath box, and back into storage for the next year. I use the timers, so it doesn't burn all night, and it works perfectly. I suspect the timer will give out first, as it's the only part that is changed all the time, and it's NOT built to last."</td>
